The video recorded from the SciPy 2019 conference can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaSpqsKaRbo).

# Installation

The code in the tutorial has been written using Python 3; most of it may also work with Python 2.7.

We **strongly recommend** using the Anaconda Python distribution. You can install either the full [anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (very extensive, but large) or [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) (much smaller, only essential packages).

Almost all of the examples will work in either the regular Jupyter notebook or in JupyterLab. The instructions below assume you will be using JupyterLab.

*We will spend a few minutes at the beginning of the tutorial pointing out some of the features of JupyterLab from the perspective of people already familiar with Jupyter notebooks.*

There are download instructions below for installation using pip, which should work with any Python distribution.

### Windows users

The installation instructions below were tested on an up-to-date version of Windows 10 Professional. If you encounter any issues on Windows please open an issue or contact us through slack.
### Installation instructions

```
conda create -n widgets-tutorial -c conda-forge python=3.7 pip notebook numpy scikit-image scipy pandas requests ipywidgets bqplot ipyvolume ipyleaflet pythreejs ipyevents ipysheet ipytree ipympl pywwt voila=0.1 jupyterlab nodejs=11.14

conda activate widgets-tutorial

# Install ipyvuetify and voila-vuetify from pip (not on conda-forge yet)
pip install ipyvuetify voila-vuetify

# Create a kernel for this environment
ipython kernel install --name widgets-tutorial --display-name widgets-tutorial --sys-prefix

# Enable JupyterLab extensions, which may take several minutes
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager bqplot ipyvolume jupyter-threejs jupyter-leaflet ipysheet ipytree jupyter-matplotlib jupyter-vuetify
```

## pip installation instructions

If you are not using the anaconda python distribution, please use the instructions below.

```
pip install notebook==5.7 numpy scipy scikit-image traitlets requests bqplot ipywidgets ipyvolume matplotlib pandas ipyleaflet pythreejs ipyevents ipysheet ipytree pywwt ipympl "voila>=0.1.2" jupyterlab ipyvuetify voila-vuetify

# If you are using JupyerLab, also run the series of labextension install command in
# the conda instructions.
```

## Check your installation

To check your installation, please download the script [install_check.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter-widgets/tutorial/master/install_check.py) and run it:

```
python install_check.py
```
